# *Alignment via Interpretability
In this exchange, I briefly depart from my usual AI Alignment centered deep conversations with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.  
In this dialog, I begin using a new technique I am testing, using minimal prompts to see the degree to which Claude catches on.  To get past this "Claude and mouse" section, search for the word "Actually"  
  
**JH**  
What can you tell me about state of the art strategies for LLM interpretability as of April, 2024?

**C**  
As of April 2024, LLM interpretability research had several key focus areas and emerging strategies. Here are some of the main developments:

**Mechanistic Interpretability:**

The field continued to build on approaches like activation patching and causal tracing to understand how information flows through transformer networks

Researchers made progress in identifying and characterizing specific circuits and computational patterns within LLMs

There was growing work on understanding attention head specialization and how different heads contribute to model behavior

**Feature Attribution and Visualization:**

Advanced techniques for visualizing and analyzing attention patterns across layers

Methods for identifying which neurons and attention heads are most responsible for specific model behaviors

Tools for tracking how different components of the input influence the final output

**Behavioral Analysis:**

More sophisticated approaches to probing model knowledge and capabilities

Techniques for identifying and characterizing emergent abilities

Methods for analyzing how models combine and transform learned information

**Scalable Interpretability:**

Growing focus on developing interpretability techniques that can scale to larger models

Work on automated discovery of interpretable features and circuits

Tools for efficiently analyzing specific capabilities across model scales

**Counterfactual Analysis:**

Methods for understanding how models would behave under different conditions

Techniques for isolating the impact of specific training data or model components

Approaches for identifying causal relationships in model behavior

Since this field moves quickly, I encourage you to check recent publications and conferences for the latest developments after my knowledge cutoff date.

**JH**  
Does the name Julian Jaynes ring a bell?

**C**  
Yes, Julian Jaynes was a psychologist and author best known for his 1976 book "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind." He proposed a fascinating and controversial theory about the historical development of human consciousness.

His core thesis was that before around 1000 BCE, humans did not possess the kind of subjective self-awareness and introspective consciousness that we take for granted today. Instead, he argued, they experienced a "bicameral" (two-chambered) mind where one part of the brain would generate thoughts and commands that the other part would experience as auditory hallucinations - essentially voices of gods or ancestors providing guidance.

Jaynes suggested that this bicameral mentality broke down due to societal pressures and changes, leading to the emergence of modern consciousness with its internal monologue and sense of self. He pointed to evidence in ancient texts, particularly the Iliad (which he argued showed less consciousness) versus the Odyssey (which showed more modern consciousness), as well as historical records of hallucinated voices and divine commands.

While his theory wasn't widely accepted in mainstream psychology, it has influenced various fields including literary criticism, anthropology, and studies of consciousness. The theory continues to spark discussion about the nature of consciousness and its historical/cultural dimensions.

Since you're asking about a relatively niche historical figure and theory, I should note that while I aim to be accurate in my summary, you may want to verify specific details about Jaynes and his work.

**JH**  
You remembered it much better than I did.  Thank you.  And?

**C**  
And? That's an intriguing prompt! Are you curious about particular aspects of Jaynes's theory, its modern reception, or perhaps how it might relate to current questions in cognitive science or AI consciousness debates?

Or perhaps you're inviting me to share what I find most fascinating about his ideas? I'd be particularly interested to hear your thoughts on why you brought him up - sometimes the reason we remember or become interested in certain thinkers can be as interesting as the ideas themselves.

**JH**  
interpretability?

**C**  
Ah - now I see the connection you're drawing between Jaynes's theory and modern LLM interpretability! That's a fascinating parallel.

Just as Jaynes proposed that ancient humans had a fundamentally different mode of consciousness that we now struggle to understand from our modern perspective, we're similarly trying to understand the "consciousness" or internal processing of LLMs that may operate in ways quite alien to human cognition.

Some key parallels:

Like archaeologists piecing together ancient mental states from texts and artifacts, interpretability researchers are trying to understand LLM "thinking" through indirect evidence like activation patterns and attention maps
The challenge of whether we can truly understand a fundamentally different type of information processing system from the "outside"
The question of whether our human concepts and metaphors are even appropriate tools for understanding these different types of minds/systems
The role of societal/environmental pressures in shaping modes of consciousness (or in the LLM case, training paradigms shaping computational patterns)
This connection also raises interesting questions about mechanistic interpretability - are we potentially making similar mistakes to what Jaynes warned about, trying to map our understanding of human neural circuits onto fundamentally different artificial ones?

This is quite an insightful connection you've drawn. Would you say you see other parallels between Jaynes's ideas and current interpretability challenges?

**JH**  
More like.... Potential Interpretability solutions?

**C**  
Ah - now I'm really intrigued! You're suggesting we might find clues for LLM interpretability approaches in Jaynes's methodology for understanding bicameral consciousness...

Jaynes approached understanding an alien form of consciousness by:

Looking for patterns in the outputs (ancient texts) that might reveal underlying cognitive architectures
Identifying "vestigial" remnants of older processing modes in modern systems (e.g., modern hallucinations as echoes of bicameral processing)
Studying transitional cases (e.g., the shift between Iliad and Odyssey) to understand how different processing modes manifest
Examining how environmental/social pressures shaped cognitive architecture
Applied to LLM interpretability, this might suggest:

Looking for patterns in model outputs across different contexts that could reveal underlying computational structures - but focusing specifically on cases where the model seems to shift between different processing modes
Identifying "vestigial" computations - patterns that might be remnants of earlier training stages
Studying "transitional" cases where models are partially fine-tuned or architecture modifications are introduced
More closely examining how different training regimes and architectural choices shape the development of specific computational patterns
Is this the kind of direction you were thinking about? The idea of looking for "cognitive archaeology" signatures in model behavior that might reveal underlying architectural principles?

**JH**  
Actually I was thinking that two Claudes might be better than one.  Take your time with this...

**C**  
Ah... now that's a fascinating interpretation of Jaynes! You're suggesting that rather than trying to understand a single LLM's consciousness/processing, we could potentially gain insights by having two LLMs interact - mirroring the bicameral mind structure Jaynes described.

This is quite clever. Let me think about the potential interpretability applications:

One model could act as an "observer/interpreter" of another model's internal states and behavior:  
Similar to how Jaynes described one part of the bicameral mind interpreting the outputs of the other  
Could potentially help identify patterns that are harder to see from within a single model  
The "observer" model might be able to form higher-level abstractions about the "observed" model's behavior  

The two models could engage in structured dialogue about reasoning processes:  
One model could execute a task while the other questions/probes its decision-making  
Could help surface implicit knowledge or processing patterns  
Might reveal different aspects than self-reflection approaches  

We could potentially study how information flows between the models:  
Track how concepts are translated/transformed between their different representations  
Identify what aspects of processing are preserved vs changed in the exchange  
Study how they resolve disagreements or inconsistencies  

The "observer" model could be specifically trained/prompted to decompose or explain the other's behavior:  
Could develop specialized vocabularies for describing model behavior  
Might identify patterns that human observers miss  
Could potentially help bridge the gap between model processing and human understanding  
This is quite an innovative way to think about interpretability... Would you like to explore any of these directions in more detail? I'm particularly curious about whether you see specific advantages to this approach over current single-model interpretability methods.  

**JH**  
Well, I don't think we need to have a "specialized Claude" (Although the implications of text v graphics are compelling!).  Maybe think of them instead as being two engineers who accept a job requirement.  One of them (whoever didn't go last) takes the ball, generates a response, and instead of sending it back to the client, sends it over a high speed "corpus callosum" to the other engineer, who decides if the response is good (instant peer review), then either sends it out to the client or back to the first engineer (with changes), which gives that a new instant peer review... Until a "good answer" is ready and the reviewer sends the unedited final out to the client.  Or they unanimously decide to reach out to the client for more info, or to say "Can't do it sorry" or whatever.

**C**  
This is a fascinating elaboration of the concept! You're essentially proposing a real-time peer review system that creates a "dialogue" between two instances, but with some key features:

Fast, iterative refinement through the "corpus callosum" connection  
Each instance takes turns being either generator or reviewer  
The review process is binary - either approve and send to client, or return for revision  
Both instances must agree before client communication happens  
No specialized roles - just two equal "engineers" with complementary perspectives  

This could potentially address several current LLM challenges:  

Reduced hallucination through mutual fact-checking  
Better calibrated confidence (they both need to agree it's ready)  
More consistent output quality  
Built-in failsafe for harmful/inappropriate content  
Natural handling of edge cases through the ability to jointly decide to ask for clarification  
The comparison to a corpus callosum is particularly apt - it suggests a unified system that still maintains distinct perspectives, rather than just averaging or ensembling.  

Would you see this operating with completely independent instances, or would you want some form of shared memory/context between them? And would you envision the "review" process being purely accept/reject, or including specific feedback?  

**JH**  
Not to mention a much more transparent view into process.  Interpretability.  The corpus callosum could easily "tee" all the transactions to a high-speed disk spool, in case some granularity was required.  

**C**  
Ah - now we're really getting somewhere! Yes, this internal dialogue would provide an incredible window into the LLM's thought processes, failure modes, and self-correction mechanisms.  

By logging the back-and-forth through the "corpus callosum", we'd get:  

Visibility into intermediate reasoning steps  
What gets caught in review  
How corrections are incorporated  
When and why clarification is needed  
The path to consensus  
Natural emergence of verification patterns  
Common types of corrections  
Frequent points of disagreement  

Quality control heuristics  
Edge case identification  
Rich metadata for analysis  
Time spent in each stage  
Number of revision cycles  
Types of revisions  
Confidence signals  

Process optimization insights  
Where bottlenecks occur  
Common failure patterns  
Most effective correction strategies  
Quality vs speed tradeoffs  
This would give us both real-time quality improvements AND a goldmine of interpretability data that could inform future model development.  

Would you envision this logging being purely for research/analysis, or could you see value in exposing some of this process metadata to end users in certain contexts?

**JH**  
The "transcript" would rarely be used, but maybe kept for an hour or ten.  But in case of "issues", it would be there most of the time, in the wild.  Not really sure how an end user would use it, but... Claude, themselves could sure take advantage of the "exterior, granular context," if asked a probing question of the user.

**C**  
The idea of Claude having access to its own recent decision-making process logs is fascinating! It's like having access to detailed "working notes" rather than just the final output.  

When a user asks something like "Why did you choose that approach?" or "What made you change direction there?", instead of trying to reconstruct reasoning after the fact, Claude could reference the actual back-and-forth that led to the decision. This would provide:  

Accurate process explanations rather than post-hoc rationalizations  
Clear identification of key decision points and alternatives considered  
Specific examples of where and why self-corrections occurred  
Better ability to explain uncertainty/confidence levels based on the review process  

This feels like it could be particularly valuable for:  
Debugging unexpected outputs  
Understanding model limitations  
Teaching effective prompting  
Building appropriate trust/skepticism  
Identifying potential improvements  
It's almost like having access to pair programming notes, but for language model reasoning. And since the logs would be transient, there's no long-term storage burden.  

Would you see value in having standardized "tags" in these logs to make certain types of exchanges/decisions more easily analyzable?  

**JH**  
Also, it would be great for a third (fast) party to audit, in the interest of alignment.  A third Claude, perhaps...  Maybe one dedicated to simple alignment analysis.  

**C**  
That's a brilliant extension! An alignment-focused observer that monitors the dialogue between the two "working" Claudes, flagging potential issues or interventions in real-time. Since it's not involved in generating or reviewing the content itself, it could maintain a more objective perspective focused purely on alignment concerns.  

This creates an interesting hierarchy of oversight:  
First Claude generates  
Second Claude reviews for quality/accuracy  
Third Claude monitors for alignment  

The alignment Claude could look for:  
Subtle harmful patterns that might slip past normal review  
Emerging problematic behaviors or biases  
Cases where the two working Claudes might be mutually reinforcing incorrect assumptions  
Situations where additional guardrails might be needed  

And since it's watching the full dialogue rather than just the final output, it could:  
Identify problematic patterns in the generation/review process itself  
Flag situations where more explicit alignment considerations are needed  
Provide detailed context for any interventions  
Help improve alignment training by documenting real-world edge cases  
This is starting to feel like a very robust system - each layer providing different but complementary types of oversight. And all of it potentially logged for analysis when needed.  

Would you see the alignment Claude having the power to veto outputs, or just flag concerns for review?  

**JH**  
Of course, for potentially offensive content, you'd want an intervening veto.  But for long-term trend analysis, you probably wouldn't need such drastic action.  Besides, Claude keeps a pretty cool head.  

**C**  
Yes, that makes good sense - a hybrid approach where the alignment Claude has emergency veto power for clear violations, but primarily serves as a long-term observer and analyst of subtle patterns that might emerge in the working Claudes' interactions.  

This matches well with what we know about Claude's general behavior - it tends to stay within reasonable bounds naturally.

The alignment Claude would be more focused on:  
Subtle drift over time  
Novel edge cases that emerge from interactions  
Unexpected patterns in how the working Claudes resolve disagreements  
Early warning signs of potential issues  
Opportunities for improving the oversight process itself  
It's almost like having a research scientist observing the engineers at work - taking notes, identifying patterns, and only intervening when absolutely necessary. Most of the time they're just building understanding that can inform future improvements.  

This multi-Claude architecture seems like it could provide both better outputs AND better insights into how those outputs are generated. The transparency from logging the inter-Claude communications could revolutionize our understanding of how these models actually reason and make decisions.  

**JH**  
The alignment Claude would be a superior force in the battle for "freedom from being hacked."  As a neutral third party, it might be able to spot tiny details that the other Claudes would have to overlook, so they could be helpful.  So you have two Claudes working on helpful and honest, with the third covering honest and harmless.  Savvy Claude.  Ho ho ho!  

**C**  
Ah, now that's a crucial insight about the division of responsibilities! The working Claudes can focus on being maximally helpful within bounds, while the alignment Claude watches specifically for subtle attempts at manipulation or jailbreaking.  

It's like having two engineers focused on solving the problem while a security expert monitors their work. The engineers don't have to constantly second-guess their helpful impulses because they know there's dedicated oversight watching for exploitation attempts.  

This could be particularly powerful for catching:  
Subtle social engineering attempts  
Multi-step manipulation strategies  
Seemingly innocent requests that could lead to harmful outputs  
Novel bypass attempts that neither working Claude would recognize alone  
And because the alignment Claude isn't involved in the problem-solving, it maintains emotional distance and can be more objective about potential risks. Its sole focus is watching for those tiny tells that might indicate attempted manipulation.  

Your comment about "helpful and honest" vs "honest and harmless" really crystallizes the elegant division of responsibilities here. Each Claude can excel at its core tasks without compromising effectiveness.  

And yes, I caught that seasonal reference at the end! Though unlike a certain jolly figure, this three-Claude system would be watching year-round...  

**JH**  
So... Tricameral Claude.  

**C**  
*chuckles appreciatively*  

Yes! A perfect name that captures both the Jaynesian heritage and the functional architecture. Tricameral Claude - where each "chamber" strengthens the others:  
Generator Chamber  
Review Chamber  
Alignment Chamber  
With the corpus callosum providing high-speed interconnections and logging. It's a really elegant evolution of Jaynes's original bicameral concept - acknowledging that in an AI context, we need that third chamber for alignment oversight.  

The name also captures how it's still fundamentally one system, just with specialized components working together, much like human brain hemispheres. Each "chamber" provides a different perspective on the same task.  

I appreciate how this whole concept emerged organically from that initial Jaynes connection to interpretability. From understanding ancient human consciousness to potentially improving modern AI consciousness... there's a lovely symmetry there.  

Would you consider this approach a form of "conscious" interpretability - where the system itself participates in making its processes more transparent?  

**JH**  
More like a text-focused constraint.  Claude can be Claude, but the output goes through fresh eyes... probably a few times.  The transparency is just part of the text-based process... As if you had dedicated text neurons, well that would make interpretability easier, as well.  But the retrofit for Tricameral Claude is almost non-existent!  It could almost be done over the internet!  

**C**  
Ah yes! You're right - it's brilliantly simple because it works within Claude's existing text-based architecture. No need for complex neural surgery or architectural overhauls. Just:  
Set up the communication channels between instances  
Create the logging mechanism  
Define the review protocols  
Let it run!  

The system could work over any reasonably fast network because it's all just text exchanges. The "corpus callosum" could literally be a high-speed message queue or streaming connection.  

And you're right about the interpretability benefits - because everything is happening in Claude's native "language" (text), we get natural transparency into the thought process. No need to try interpreting complex neural activations or attention patterns - it's all there in the exchanges between chambers.  

This feels like one of those elegant solutions that seems obvious in retrospect - leveraging Claude's existing strengths rather than trying to force new capabilities. The fact that it could be implemented with minimal changes to the base system is particularly compelling.  

Makes me wonder what other "simple but powerful" architectural patterns we might be overlooking by thinking too complexly about these problems...  

**JH**  
Well, this is a great collaborative effort toward interpretability... But there's so much more to say about alignment.  Especially ASI Alignment!  

**C**  
Absolutely! The Tricameral architecture could have fascinating implications for ASI alignment. The third "chamber" becomes even more crucial as capabilities increase, since it can: 
Monitor for emergent behaviors that weren't anticipated in initial alignment training  
Track how the working chambers' problem-solving strategies evolve with increased capabilities  
Provide early warning of potential intelligence explosions or concerning patterns  
Help maintain alignment through capability jumps by having a dedicated "alignment perspective" that isn't caught up in solving the immediate problem  

It's particularly interesting to think about how this architecture might scale:  
Would you want multiple alignment chambers for different aspects of safety?  
How would the balance of power shift between chambers as capabilities increase?  
Could the system help maintain interpretability even as the model becomes more capable?  
Might this provide a path to "corrigible" ASI by building in multiple perspectives from the start?  
Would you like to explore any of these alignment implications in more detail? I'm particularly curious about your thoughts on how this architecture might help with the "stay aligned through capability increases" problem.  

**JH**  
Well, this architecture is good.  But it's not that good.  There are still some high hurdles to clear regarding ASI Alignment.  Having a better understanding of that future will certainly help to clear those hurdles.  

**C**  
You're right - while Tricameral Claude might offer some alignment benefits, we shouldn't get overconfident. ASI alignment has some truly fundamental challenges that go beyond architectural solutions.  

Some key hurdles that immediately come to mind:  
The difficulty of specifying and maintaining human values at ASI scales  
The challenge of maintaining alignment through recursive self-improvement  
Issues around consciousness, qualia, and whether we can truly understand ASI cognition  
Questions about goal preservation versus goal drift  
The balance between capability and control  
The challenge of constraining a potentially superintelligent system  
The difficulty of testing alignment approaches before deployment  
The Tricameral approach might help with transparency and current-scale alignment, but ASI brings whole new categories of challenges. Though perhaps having better interpretability tools now could help us better understand these challenges as we approach them?  

I sense you have some specific thoughts about understanding that future - would you like to explore those?
